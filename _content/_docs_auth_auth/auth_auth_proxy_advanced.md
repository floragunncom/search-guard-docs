## Originating IP addresses

Some features of Search Guard operate on the IP address of the client: This includes `accept.ips` and `skip.ips` in `sg_authc.yml`, or the IP-based role assignment in `sg_roles_mapping.yml`. 

When operating Search Guard behind a proxy, however, it is always the IP address of the proxy which creates the connections to Search Guard. To be able to
use the actual originating client IP anyway, Search Guard uses the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header to determine the originating client IP whenever a trusted proxy is configured.

Search Guard checks the IP addresses listed in the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header from right to the left; the first IP address which does not match the `network.trusted_proxies` CIDR pattern, will be considered the actual originating IP address.

**Note:** This IP address will be then used by the `sg_authc.yml` settings `accept.ips` and `skip.ips`. If you want to check the IP address of the direct connection, you can use `accept.direct_ips` and `skip.direct_ips`. 

If your proxy uses a different name of the `X-Forward-For` header, you can configure that name in `sg_authc.yml` with the option `network.http.remote_ip_header`.
