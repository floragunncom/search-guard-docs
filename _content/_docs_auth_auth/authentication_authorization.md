# Configuring authentication
{: .no_toc}


Search Guard offers you a great variety of different authentication modules and configuration options.

The basic configuration is often very simple; still, Search Guard offers powerful mechanisms to work with special use-cases and setups.

You can choose now:

- Do you want to jump directly to one of the "Quick Start" docs for a particular authentication mode?
  - [Password-based authentication](http-basic-authorization)
  - [LDAP and Active Directory](active-directory-ldap)
  - [JWT](json-web-tokens)

**Note:** OIDC and SAML based authentication is only available for Kibana. See the documentation on [Kibana authentication](kibana-authentication) for details.
