# Using fluentd with Search Guard
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Fluentd connects to Elasticsearch on the REST layer, just like a browser or curl. To use fluentd with a Search Guard secured cluster:

* set up a fluentd user with permissions to read and write to the fluentd index
* configure fluentd to use HTTPS instead of HTTP (optional, only applicable if you enabled HTTPS on the REST layer)
* configure fluentd to provide HTTP Basic Authentication credentials when connecting to Elasticsearch / Search Guard

## Setting up the fluentd user and role

For fluentd being able to write to Elasticsearch, set up a role first that has full access to the fluentd index. Let's assume you use a daily rolling index in fluentd like:

```
index_name fluentd-%Y%m%d
```

You then would set up a Search Guard role that has access to all indices starting with `fluentd-`.

**sg\_roles.yml:**

```
sg_fluentd:
  cluster:
    - CLUSTER_MONITOR  
    - CLUSTER_COMPOSITE_OPS_RO
  indices:
    'fluentd-*':
      '*':
        - UNLIMITED
```

If you use the Search Guard internal user database, set up a fluentd user.

**sg\_internal\_users.yml:**

```
fluentd:
  hash: $2y$12$pcoEhYWjbiMqQldLgK/dnezy9DXzi/wahiADmiYVPvNmzoGWiKoVi
```

Last, map the `fluentd` user to the `sg_fluentd` Search Guard role:


**sg\_roles\_mapping.yml:**

```
sg_fluentd:
  users:
    - fluentd
```
    
## Configuring the Elasticsearch output

In your `td-agent.conf` make sure you provide the username and password of the fluentd user you have configured above.

If you configured Search Guard to use `HTTPS` instead of `HTTP`, make sure you set the `scheme` to `https`.

If you use self-signed certificates, set `ssl_verify` to `none`.

```
<match apache.access>
 @type             elasticsearch
