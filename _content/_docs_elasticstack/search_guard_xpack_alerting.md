# Using Search Guard with X-Pack Alerting
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Search Guard provides [**free Alerting for Elasticsearch**](elasticsearch-alerting-getting-started), perfectly integrated with all security features.
{: .note .js-note .note-info}


Search Guard is compatible with the X-Pack Alerting component. 

This documentation assumes that you already installed and configured Kibana and the [Search Guard Kibana](kibana-plugin-installation) plugin.

## Elasticsearch: Enable Alerting

In `elasticsearch.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Alerting:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.watcher.enabled: true
...
```

## Elasticsearch: Add the alerting user

For using X-Pack Alerting, the respective user must have the built-in `SGS_XP_ALERTING` and `SGS_KIBANA_USER` role assigned.
      
## Kibana: Enable X-Pack Alerting

In `kibana.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Alerting:


```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.watcher.enabled: true
...
```

{% include es8_migration_note.html deprecated_properties="xpack.security.enabled, xpack.watcher.enabled" %}
