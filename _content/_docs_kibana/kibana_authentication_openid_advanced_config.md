# OpenID Connect Advanced Configuration
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

This chapter lists all advanced configuration options for OIDC. Most of them are only needed for specific setups.

## Using the OIDC user info endpoint

You can use the OIDC user info endpoint to retrieve additional user information in addition to the claims stored in the OIDC ID token.

To do so, add `oidc.get_user_info` to the configuration of the auth domain. Then, Search Guard will query the user info endpoint on each login and make the result available for user mapping in the attribute `oidc_user_info`. 

### Example

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    oidc.get_user_info: true
    user_mapping.roles.from_comma_separated_string: oidc_user_info.roles
```

## Using PKCE

PKCE ("Proof Key for Code Exchange") is an extension to the OIDC authorization code flow with the goal of preventing CSRF and auth code injection attacks.  

If your IdP is capable of supporting PKCE, we are recommending to enable it in Search Guard. To do so, add `oidc.use_pkce: true` to the auth domain configuration.


## TLS Settings

If you need special TLS settings to create connections from Search Guard to the IdP, you can configure them with the options listed below. For example, such configuration might become necessary if your IdP uses TLS certificates signed by non-public certificate authorities.

**oidc.idp.tls.trusted_cas:** The root certificates to trust when connecting to the IdP. You can specify the certificates in PEM format inline or specify an absolute pathname using the syntax `#{file:/path/to/certificate.pem}`.

**oidc.idp.tls.enabled_protocols:** The enabled TLS protocols. Defaults to `["TLSv1.2", "TLSv1.1"]`.

**oidc.idp.tls.enabled_ciphers:** The enabled TLS cipher suites.

**oidc.idp.tls.verify_hostnames:** Whether to verify the hostnames of the IdPâ€™s TLS certificate or not. Default: true.

**oidc.idp.tls.trust_all:** Disable all certificate checks. You should only use this for quick tests. *Never use this for production systems.*


### Example

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    oidc.idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    oidc.idp.tls.trusted_cas: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      MIIEZjCCA06gAwIBAgIGAWTBHiXPMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMHgxEzARBgoJkiaJ
      [...]
      1k4enV7iJWXE8009a6Z0Ouwm2Bg68Wj7TAQ=
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    user_mapping.roles.from_comma_separated_string: oidc_id_token.roles
```

## TLS Client Authentication

If you need to use TLS client authentication to connect from Search Guard to the IdP, you can configure it using the following options:

**idp.tls.client_auth.certificate:** The client certificate. You can specify the certificate in PEM format inline or specify an absolute pathname using the syntax `#{file:/path/to/certificate.pem}`. You can also specify several certificates to specify a certificate chain.

**idp.tls.client_auth.private_key:** The private key that belongs to the client certificate. You can specify the key in PEM format inline or specify an absolute pathname using the syntax `#{file:/path/to/private-key.pem}`.

**idp.tls.client_auth.private_key_password:** If the private key is encrypted, you must specify the key password using this option.


## Proxy Settings

If the IdP is only reachable from Search Guard via an HTTP proxy, you can use the `idp.proxy` option to define the URI of the proxy. Optional. Defaults to no proxy.

### Example

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    oidc.idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    oidc.idp.proxy: "https://your.outbreaking.proxy:8080"
    user_mapping.roles.from_comma_separated_string: oidc_id_token.roles
```

## Mapping user attributes

Search Guard allows to use any attribute available in the JWT claims to construct [dynamic index patterns](../_docs_roles_permissions/configuration_roles_permissions.md#dynamic-index-patterns-user-name-substitution) and [dynamic queries for document and field level security](../_docs_dls_fls/dlsfls_dls.md#dynamic-queries-variable-subtitution). In order to use these attributes, you need to use the configuration option `user_mapping.attrs` to provide a mapping from JWT claim attributes to Search Guard user attributes.

This configuration options accepts a mapping of the form `search_guard_user_attribute: json_path_to_jwt_claim_attribute`. You can use JSON path expressions to specify what part of the claims you want to extract exactly.


This might look like this:

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    oidc.idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    oidc.idp.proxy: "https://your.outbreaking.proxy:8080"
    user_mapping.roles.from_comma_separated_string: oidc_id_token.roles
    user_mapping.attrs.from: 
      department: oidc_id_token.department_number
      email_address: oidc_id_token.email
```

This adds the attributes `department` and `email_address` to the Search Guard user and sets them to the respective values from the claims of the OIDC ID token. The types from the JSON claim structure are preserved, i.e., arrays remain arrays and objects remain objects, etc.

In the Search Guard role configuration, the attributes can be then used like this:

```yaml
my_dls_role:
  index_permissions:
  - index_patterns:
    - "dls_test"
    dls: '{"terms" : {"filter_attr": ${user.attrs.department|toList|toJson}}}'
    allowed_actions:
    - "READ"
```


**Note:** Take care that the mapped attributes are of reasonable size. As these attributes need to be forwarded over the network for each operation in the Elasticsearch cluster, attributes carrying a significant amount of data may cause a performance penalty.

## Using only certain sections of a JWT subject claim as user name

In some cases, the subject claim in a JWT might be more complex than needed or wanted. For example, a JWT subject claim could be specified as an email address like `exampleuser@example.com`. The `user_mapping.user_name.from.pattern` option allows you to only use the local part (i.e., `exampleuser`) as the user name inside Search Guard.

With `subject_pattern`, you specify a regular expression that defines the structure of an expected user name. You can then use capturing groups (i.e., sections enclosed in round parentheses; `(...)`) to use only a specific part of the subject supplied by the JWT as the Search Guard user name.

For example:

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    user_mapping.user_name.from.json_path: oidc_id_token.sub
    user_mapping.user_name.from.pattern: "^(.+)@example\.com$" 
    user_mapping.roles.from_comma_separated_string: oidc_id_token.roles
```

In this example, `(.+)` is the capturing group, i.e., at least one character. This group must be followed by the string `@example.com`, which must be present, but will not be part of the resulting user name in Search Guard. If you try to log in with a subject that does not match this pattern (e.g. `foo@bar`), the login will fail.

You can use all the pattern features which the Java `Pattern` class supports. See the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) for details.

Keep in mind that all capturing groups are used for constructing the user name. If you need grouping only because you want to apply a pattern quantifier or operator, you should use non-capturing groups: `(?:...)`.

Example for using capturing groups and non-capturing groups:

```yaml
      user_mapping.user_name.from.pattern: "^(.+)@example\.(?:com|org)$"
```

In this example, the group around `com` and `org` must use the alternative operator `|`. But it must be non-capturing because otherwise it would show up in the user name.

You can also use several capturing groups if you want to use these groups for the user name:

```yaml
      user_mapping.user_name.from.pattern: "^(.+)@example\.com|(.+)@foo\.bar$"
```

## Logout URL

If you want to customize the URL that Kibana will navigate to when the user selects the "Logout" menu item, use the `logout` option.

```yaml
default:
  auth_domains:
  - type: oidc
    oidc.client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    oidc.client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    oidc.idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    oidc.logout_url: "https://your.idp/logout"
```

## Rate-limiting connections to the IdP

It is possible to DOS attack an OpenID-based infrastructure by sending tokens with randomly generated, non-existing key ids at a high frequency. Search Guard will only allow a maximum number of new key ids in a certain time frame to mitigate this. If more unknown key ids are received, Search Guard will return an HTTP status code 503 (Service not available) and refuse to query the IdP. By default, Search Guard does not allow for more than 10 unknown key ids in a time window of 10 seconds. You can control these settings by the following configuration keys:

**refresh_rate_limit_count:**  The maximum number of unknown key ids in the time window. Default: 10

**refresh_rate_limit_time_window_ms:** The time window to use when checking the maximum number of unknown key ids, in milliseconds. Default: 10000
