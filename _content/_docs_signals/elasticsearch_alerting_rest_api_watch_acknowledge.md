# Acknowledge Watch API
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}



## Endpoint

```
PUT /_signals/watch/{tenant}/{watch_id}/_ack
```

```
PUT /_signals/watch/{tenant}/{watch_id}/_ack/{action_id}
```

These endpoints can be used to acknowledge actions performed by watches. By acknowledging actions, you can temporarily suppress further executions of these actions. 

When an action is acknowledged, its checks will be still executed on schedule. The actual action however won't be executed until the checks determined the action to be inapplicable during at least one scheduled run.  If the checks change their state again afterwards, the action will be normally executed again.

The user who acknowledged a watch or action is tracked and can be obtained using the watch state REST API.

It is possible to withdraw the acknowledgement using the `DELETE` verb on this endpoint. See [Un-acknowledge Watch API](elasticsearch-alerting-rest-api-watch-unacknowledge) for details.

Please see also extended version of the requests which returns additional information [Acknowledge And Get Watch](elasticsearch-alerting-rest-api-watch-acknowledge-and-get).
