## Basics

When the checks configured in a watch found a situation to be noteworthy, it's time to take action. This is done using the equally named watch building block: Actions.

Actions can be used to send notifications by e-mail or other messaging services such as [Slack](actions_slack.md). Also, actions allow to write data to [Elasticsearch indices](actions_index.md). A general purpose mechanism to invoke external services is the [webhook action](actions_webhook.md) which allows making HTTP requests to configurable endpoints.

A watch can have several actions; either for sending notifications via different media, or for acting differently depending on the situation.

## Invoking actions

Actions are generally invoked if all checks configured for a watch ran with a positive result. Thus, if a condition configured in the checks evaluates to false, watch execution is aborted an no actions are invoked. The actions operate on the runtime data collected by these checks.

Still, it is possible to configure further action-specific checks. This way, it is for example possible to configure different escalation levels: Certain actions will only be triggered when certain values exceed a further threshold. Also, action-specific checks can be used to prepare further runtime data for the action. Modifications of the runtime data done by action-specific checks are always scoped to this action and are invisible to other actions.

**Note:** By using the severity feature, you can configure actions to be executed only if a certain problem severity was determined before. Also, you can configure resolve actions which get executed if the problem severity decreased. See [Severity](severity.md) for details.



## Action Types

These action types are available at the moment:

**[E-Mail Action Type](actions_email.md):** Sends e-mails to configurable recipients. Mail content can be defined using templating.

**[Slack Action Type](actions_slack.md):** Sends Slack messages to configurable recipients. Message content is templateable as well.

**[Webhook Action Type](actions_webhook.md):** Sends HTTP requests to external services.

**[Index Action Type](actions_index.md):** Writes data to an Elasticsearch index.

These action types are only available in the Enterprise Edition:

**[Pager Duty Action Type](actions_pagerduty.md):** Triggers and resolves incidents in PagerDuty.

**[Jira Action Type](actions_jira.md):** Creates issues in Jira.

## Suppressing Execution of Actions

In order to avoid getting spammed or flooded by automatic notifications caused by actions, Signals provides two mechanisms: [Throttling](#action-throttling) automatically suppresses the repeated execution of actions for a configurable amount of time. Furthermore, users can [acknowledge](#acknowledging-actions) actions which suppresses action execution until the checks of a watch change their state.

### Action Throttling

For each action, a `throttle_period` can be configured. Throttle periods are time durations during which execution of the particular action will be suppressed after it was executed. This way, a watch can be configured to be run very frequently in order to get quickly notified about newly commencing situations. Yet, actions would be triggered less frequently â€“ in the frequency configured by the throttle period.

If actions are throttled, the watches are still executed. The watch log will contain information about the execution and list the respective actions as throttled.

Throttle periods can be either constant time values like `1h` (1 hour) or `10m` (10 minutes). Alternatively, you can specify throttle periods which increase while the situation recognized by the watch persists. These throttle periods are called exponential periods. You also use the `throttle_period`  attribute for configuring exponential periods. The initial throttling and the increase is configured using a special syntax of the value.  The syntax is `duration ** basis of exponentiation |  maximum duration`. For example, the value `1m**2|1h` would pause notifications after the initial notification for these durations: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 8 minutes, 16 minutes, 32 minutes, 60 minutes. Afterwards, notifications are repeated every 60 minutes until the situation which causes the action is resolved. The specification of a maximum duration is optional, so you can also just write `1m**2`. The maximum duration then defaults to one day.

Supported units for simple throttle periods and exponential throttle periods are m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

A throttle period can be also specified on the level of a watch. This then serves as a default throttle period for all actions. Actions can still define specific throttle periods, though.

If no explicit throttle period is configured, a default throttle period of 10 seconds is used. This default can be adjusted using the Signals settings. See the section on [Administration](administration.md) for details.

### Acknowledging Actions

A manual way of suppressing the execution of actions is acknowledging actions.

If an action is acknowledged, its execution is suppressed for an indefinite amount of time. Still, the watch continues to be executed on its normal schedule. During each watch execution, all checks are executed to determine if a watch is still in alert state. If the watch remains in alert state, the action remains acknowledged and thus execution is suppressed. Only if the watch leaves alert state, the acknowledge state of the action is reset. Thus, if the situation changes again that the watch reaches alert state, the action would be actually executed again.

A watch can be acknowledged via the [Signals Kibana plugin](elasticsearch-alerting-throttling#deeplinks-for-acknowledging-actions), or via the [REST API](rest_api_watch_acknowledge.md). The user who acknowledged a watch is recorded in the watch logs and the watch state. The watch state can be retrieved with the [Watch State REST API](rest_api_watch_state.md).

## Processing Collections of Objects in Actions

Some types of watches can produce several objects at once which then need to be processed by actions.

There are at least two ways of achieving this task:

* Executing an action once which condenses the object collection using scripts or templates
* Executing an action for each object from the collection.

Especially for notification actions, the first approach is strongly recommended. It is not feasible to have a potentially unbounded number of notifications being sent by one watch.

For achieving this, you can use for example loops in Mustache templates. This might look like this:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```json
{
	"checks": [
        {
            "type": "search",
            "name": "errors",
            "target": "errors",
            "request": {
                "indices": ["errors"],
                "body": {}
            }
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "slack",
            "name": "slack_info",
            "channel": "#notifications",
            "text": "Found errors:\n{{#data.errors.hits.hits}}\n* {{_source.message}} {{/data.errors.hits.hits}}"
        }
    ]
}
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

In some cases, however, it will get necessary to execute the action for each element of a collection. This can be achieved by setting the `foreach` attribute of an action to a Painless expression producing a collection. The action will be then executed for each element of that collection. To access the current element of the collection, use the property called `item`. The `data` property is still providing a view of the complete runtime data.

In order to avoid actions being accidentally executed on very large collections, the amount of iterations is limited. By default, an action is only executed for the first 100 elements of a collection. This limit can be changed by setting the `foreach_limit` property of an action.

A watch using the `foreach` property might look like this:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```json
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "type": "search",
            "name": "errors",
            "target": "errors",
            "request": {
                "indices": ["errors"],
                "body": {}
            }
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "webhook",
            "name": "post_error_to_webhook",
            "foreach": "data.errors.hits.hits",
            "throttle_period": "10m",
            "request": {
                "method": "POST",
                "url": "https://my.test.web.hook/endpoint",
                "body": "{{item._source.message}}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## Common Action Properties

All action types share a set of common configuration properties. Consider the following example action:

```json
 {
	"actions": [
		{
			"type": "email",
			"name": "my_email_action",
			"checks": [
				{
					"type": "condition.script",
					"source": "data.bad_weather_flights.hits.total.value > 100"
				}
			],
			"throttle_period": "1h",
		}
	]
}
```

The common configuration attributes are:

**type:** The type of the action. Required. Can be index, email, slack or webhook right now.

**name:** A name identifying this action. Required.

**checks:** Further checks which can gather or transform data and decide whether to execute the actual action. Optional.

**foreach:** Executes the action for each element of a collection. The collection to use is identified by the Painless expression specified for this attribute. Optional see [Processing Collections of Objects in Actions](#processing-collections-of-objects-in-actions) for details.

**foreach_limit:** Specifies the maximum allowed number of iterations performed when using `foreach`. Optional. Defaults to 100.

Alert actions (i.e., non-resolve actions) additionally support  these properties:

**throttle_period:** The throttle period. Optional. Specify the time duration using an *amount*, followed by its *unit*. Alternatively, specify an exponential throttle period using the syntax *duration*`**`*basis of exponentiation*`|` *maximum duration*. Supported units are m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). For example, `1h` means one hour.  

**severity:** Selects the severity levels in which this action shall be executed. Optional. An array of `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`. See the section on [Severity](severity.md) for details.


Resolve actions additionally support these properties:

**resolves_severity:** Selects the severity levels which need to be resolved in order to execute this action. Mandatory. An array of `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`. See the section on [Severity](severity.md) for details.
