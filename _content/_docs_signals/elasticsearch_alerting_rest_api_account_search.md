# Search Accounts
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}


```
GET /_signals/account/_search
```

```
POST /_signals/account/_search
```

Searches for accounts. Search criteria and options can be specified in a manner similar to the ElasticSearch document search REST API.

Both the GET and the POST HTTP method can be used with the same effect.

## Query Parameters

**from:** Specifies an offset into the result list. Starting from this offset, the results will be returned. Optional.

**size:** Specifies the maximum number of accounts to be returned. Optional, defaults to 10. If scrolling is enabled, this specifies the maximum number of accounts to be returned in one scroll iteration. 

**scroll:** Configures the search to be scrollable. Optional. The value of this parameter must be a time duration value (like `1m` for one minute) during which the scroll will be available. If scrolling is enabled, the response will contain a `_scroll_id`. The value of this attribute must be passed to the standard ES REST endpoint `_search/scroll` to continue scrolling.



## Request Body

The request body specifies search options like the ElasticSearch document search REST API.

If no request body is specified, all accounts will be returned; limited to the amount specified to the `size` query parameter.

Important attributes of the request body are:

**query:** An ES document query.

**sort:** Specifies the attributes by which the result shall be sorted.
