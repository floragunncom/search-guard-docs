# Put Watch API
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}


## Endpoint

```
PUT /_signals/watch/{tenant}/{watch_id}
```

Stores or updates a watch identified by the `{watch_id}` path parameter. By default, the watch will be active and scheduled for execution.

**Important** When a watch is created or updated, a snapshot of the privileges of the user performing the operation will be stored with the watch. When the stored watch is executed, it will have exactly these privileges. If a user modifies a watch created by another user, the user must ensure that they still have enough privileges to allow successful execution of the watch. See also the chapter on the [security execution context](elasticsearch-alerting-security-security-context).

## Path Parameters

**{tenant}:** The name of the tenant in which the watch shall be stored. `_main` refers to the default tenant. Users of the community edition will can only use `_main` here.

**{watch_id}** The id of the watch to be created or updated. Required.

## Request Body

The watch needs to be specified as JSON document in the request body.

## Responses

### 200 OK

A watch identified by the given id existed before. The watch was successfully updated.

### 201 Created

A watch identified by the given id did not exist before. The watch was successfully created.

### 400 Bad Request

The request was malformed.

If the watch specified in the request body was malformed, a JSON document containing detailed validation errors will be returned in the response body. See the [invalid watch example](#invalid-watch) for details.


### 403 Forbidden

The user does not have the permission to create watches for the currently selected tenant.


### 415 Unsupported Media Type

The watch was not encoded as JSON document. Watches need to be sent using the media type application/json.

## Permissions

For being able to access the endpoint, the user needs to have the privilege `cluster:admin:searchguard:tenant:signals:watch/put` for the currently selected tenant.

This permission is included in the following [built-in action groups](elasticsearch-alerting-security-permissions):

* SGS\_SIGNALS\_ALL
* SGS\_SIGNALS\_WATCH\_MANAGE

## Examples
