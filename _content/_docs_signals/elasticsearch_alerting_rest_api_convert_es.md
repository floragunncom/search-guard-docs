# Convert Watch API
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

This feature is experimental at the moment! 
{: .note .js-note .note-warning}

## Endpoint

```
POST /_signals/convert/es
```

Converts a watch definition in ES Watcher format into Signals format. The result of the conversion is returned in the response body. Furthermore, the response body will list any potential problems that were found during the conversion.

The watch is not stored in Signals. It is up to the caller to `PUT` the watch afterwards.

## Request Body

A watch in ES Watcher format as a JSON document.

## Responses

### 200 OK

The watch could be converted; the conversion is possibly only partial. The returned JSON document will then list potential problems.

### 400 Bad Request

The JSON document could not be parsed.

## Examples

### Basic
