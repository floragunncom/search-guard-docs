# Sample Watches
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

To start quickly with Signals, we have prepared sample watches that are based on the [Kibana sample data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html).

All sample watches can be found on Gitlab. You can install them either manually via the [REST API](rest_api.md). Or, use the Signals Kibana plugin to install them.

## Average ticket price

The watch alerts if the average price among all flight tickets is less than the threshold N (default 800).
