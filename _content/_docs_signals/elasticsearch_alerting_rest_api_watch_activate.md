### 403 Forbidden

The user does not have the permission to activate or deactivate watches for the currently selected tenant. 

### 404 Not found

## Permissions

For being able to access the endpoint, the user needs to have the privilege `cluster:admin:searchguard:tenant:signals:watch/activate_deactivate` for the currently selected tenant.

This permission is distinct for the permission required to create or updated watches. Thus, a user may be allowed to activate or deactivate watches without being allowed to create or update watches.

This permission is included in the following [built-in action groups](security_permissions.md):

* SGS\_SIGNALS\_WATCH\_ACTIVATE

## Examples

### Deactivate a Watch 

```
DELETE /_signals/watch/_main/bad_weather/_active
```

**Response**

```
200 OK
```
