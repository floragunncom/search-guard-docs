# Getting started with Signals Alerting for Elasticsearch
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Since v40, Signals Alerting for Elasticsearch is distributed as part of Search Guard. To use Signals, you just need to [install the Search Guard plugin for Elasticsearch and  (optional) Kibana](search-guard-versions) version 40 and above.

Signals is enabled by default, so after the cluster is up you can either use the [REST API](elasticsearch-alerting-rest-api-overview) or the Signals Kibana app to create your first watch.

If you need to disable it, add the following setting to your `elasticsearch.yml`:

```
signals.enabled: false
```

## Users and permissions

Signals integrates perfectly with the Search Guard role-based access control features, so you can define what Search Guard roles should be permitted to use Signals. Signals ships with [pre-defined alerting action groups](elasticsearch-alerting-security-permissions) that can be assigned to any Search Guard role.

A role with full access to all Signals features looks like:

```
sg_signals_manager:
  cluster_permissions:
    - SGS_SIGNALS_ACCOUNT_MANAGE
    - SGS_CLUSTER_COMPOSITE
  index_permissions:
    ...
  tenant_permissions:
    - tenant_patterns:
        - 'SGS_GLOBAL_TENANT'
      allowed_actions:
        - 'SGS_SIGNALS_ALL'
```

Note that Signals is fully compatible with [Search Guard multi-tenancy](kibana-multi-tenancy), which means watches and watch execution can be separated by tenants.

## Sample watches

To start quickly with Signals, we have [prepared sample watches](elasticsearch-alerting-watches-sample) that can be either installed by using the REST API, or the Kibana plugin.

The examples are based on the [Kibana sample data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/add-sample-data.html), so you need to import it first.

## First steps

In order to get to speed with Signals quickly, we recommend following our [Signals Alerting: First Steps](https://search-guard.com/signals-elasticsearch-alerting/) blog post. We will release a series of articles describing all Signals features in detail.
