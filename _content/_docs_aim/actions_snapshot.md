# Snapshot Action
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

This action takes a snapshot of the index that can be restored in case the index gets corrupted or deleted unintentionally.
The action requires a `repository` in which the snapshot gets stored.
The snapshot name is based on the index name and date of creation following the pattern `<index_name>_<date>`.
If the optional parameter `name_prefix` is configured the pattern would be `<name_prefix>_<index_name>_<date>`.

Since snapshots can take some time to finish, this action is implemented asynchronously.
This means a separate internal step is automatically added to the policy to check if the snapshot has finished.
Until the snapshot is finished successfully the index remains in the internal `awaiting_snapshot` step.
No other steps, actions or conditions run during this phase.

Asynchronous actions are always required to be the last action in a step.
