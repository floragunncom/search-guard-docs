# Close Action
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

This action closes the index. After this action, the index is blocked from read and write operations.
This action is useful in case the data needs to be preserved but not queried or extended.
Closing an index reduces overhead on the cluster.

## Example

```json
{
  "steps": [
    ...
    {
      "name": "my-step",
      "conditions": [ ... ],
      "actions": [
        ...
        {
          "type": "close"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
