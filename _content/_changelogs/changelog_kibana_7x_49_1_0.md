# Search Guard Kibana Plugin 49.1

**Release Date: 2021-03-26**

The this is a maintenance release for the Search Guard Kibana Plugin which fixes a number of bugs. These are only relevant for specific setups. If you are using such setups and experience problems, then upgrading is recommended.

See below for details.

## `kibana.yml` Configuration 

We fixed multiple issues with the Kibana configuration which were introduced in SG 49.0. They are:

- Read the config if the path is declared in the environment variable.
- Read the config if the path is declared in the CLI arguments (-c/--config)
- Resolve environment variables declared in the config.

## Kibana Session Cookie Settings

Fixed a regression where `searchguard.cookie.ttl: 0` in `kibana.yml` would invalidate the cookie immediately instead of setting the lifetime to the entire browser session.
