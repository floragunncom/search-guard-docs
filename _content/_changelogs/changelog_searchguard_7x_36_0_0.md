# Changelog for Search Guard 7.x-36.0.0

**Release Date: 23.07.2019**

* [Upgrade Guide from 6.x to 7.x](../_docs_installation/installation_upgrading_6_7.md)

## Security Fixes 

n/a

## Features

* Introduce search\_guard\_roles for internal users ([PR #706](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard/pull/706){:target="_blank"})
  * This makes it possible to assign Search Guard roles directly to internal users without the need for using the role mapping
  * [Internal users database](internal-users-database){:target="_blank"}

* Added `searchguard.filter_sgindex_from_all_requests` option in elasticsearch.yml to filter out the searchguard index from all-index requests
  * When set to `true` Search Guard will under the hood filter out the searchguard index from requests targeting `all` indices like `*` or `_all` 
  * Default is `false` to make this change to a breaking change (will be `true` by default in future releases)

* Added ChaCha20 support for TLS 1.2 ([Commit 2e99232](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard/commit/2e99232e5ff45d5537c37c709636956a1ec4d7a8){:target="_blank"})
  * This requires Oracle JDK >= 12 or OpenSSL 1.1.1

* Make it possible to disable built-in roles ([PR #708](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard/pull/708){:target="_blank"})
  * Search Guard 7 introduced new static built-in resources like roles and action groups. For backwards-compatibility with Search Guard 6, the static resources can be disabled in elasticsearch.yml by setting:
  * `searchguard.unsupported.load_static_resources: false`
  
## Fixes

* [BREAKING] Use "backend_roles" instead of "roles" for the authinfo  endpoint([PR #707](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard/pull/707){:target="_blank"})
  * In the JSON returned by the authinfo endpoint, "roles" have been renamed to "backend_roles" to make it clear that the listed roles are not Search Guard roles.
