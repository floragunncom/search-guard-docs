# Search Guard Kibana Plugin 52.1

**Release Date: 2021-11-15**

## Bug Fixes

### Kibana Saved Object Migraton

When updating Kibana from 7.11.x to 7.13.x, 7.14.x, there could be an error similar to the following during the Kibana startup process:

```
Unable to fulfill migration for index .kibana_..., TypeError: Cannot read property 'getValueInBytes' of undefined
```

This bugfix release fixes that problem; saved object migrations will now run again without an error.

The bugfix requires that also the Search Guard Elasticsearch Plugin 52.4.0 is installed.
