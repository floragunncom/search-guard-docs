<br />

* Signals: Painless whitelist and Mustache map attributes disagree about the structure of SeverityMapping.EvaluationResult

* Update Jackson Databind
  * Jackson reports a [security vulnerability](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2653){:target="_blank"} which affects jackson-databind-2.8.11.1
  * Search Guard is not affected by this vulnerability:
     * No direct input from untrusted sources, no polymorphic type deserialisation, not use of "gadget types" in JSON POJOs
  * Jackson has been upgraded nonetheless in Search Guard and the TLS Tool
