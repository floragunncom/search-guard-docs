## Multi-Tenancy
<span style="color:red">**Please make sure to read the documentation for [upgrading to Search Guard FLX 2.0.0](sg-200-upgrade)**</span>

### BREAKING: Multi-Tenancy has been reimplemented

Search Guard no longer maintains separate indices for each tenant. Instead, when multi-tenancy is enabled, it modifies saved objects
on the storage level. The IDs of saved objects are extended with the tenant ID, and a new attribute `sg_tenant` is added 
to each saved object, which contains the tenant ID. Search Guard modifies all saved objects except those belonging to the Global tenant.

### BREAKING: The Kibana Multi-Tenancy configuration has moved to the backend plugin

The Multi-Tenancy configuration has been moved from the Kibana plugin to the Elasticsearch plugin, and will need to be removed from `kibana.yml`.
Instead, some of the settings are now available in `sg_frontend_multi_tenancy.yml`.
Some settings have been removed, including support for the private tenant.
This applies to the settings prefixed `searchguard.multitenancy.`:


| Setting                   | Status          | Corresponding setting in sg_frontend_multi_tenancy.yml |
| ------------------------- |-----------------| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| enabled                   | moved           | enabled                                                |
| tenants.enable_global     | moved           | global_tenant_enabled                                  |
| tenants.enable_private    | removed         |                               |
| tenants.preferred         | moved           | preferred_tenants                                      |
| show_roles                | removed         |                                                        |
| enable_filter             | removed         |                                                        |
| saved_objects_migration.* | removed         |                                                        |
| debug                     | still available |


### BREAKING: Support for Private tenants have been removed

Private tenants are no longer supported. 

You can still use the Global tenant and define an arbitrary number of additional tenants in `sg_tenants.yml`.

### BREAKING: Permissions required to authorize users to access the Kibana user interface have been changed
If Multi-Tenancy is disabled, then the following roles `SGS_KIBANA_USER`, `SGS_KIBANA_USER_NO_GLOBAL_TENANT` and `SGS_KIBANA_USER_NO_DEFAULT_TENANT` are insufficient for a user to access the Kibana user interface. The role `SGS_KIBANA_USER_NO_MT` should be used instead. For more details, please see [Search Guard 2.0.0 Upgrade Guide](sg-200-upgrade).
