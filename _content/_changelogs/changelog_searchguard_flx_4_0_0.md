# Search Guard FLX 4.0.0

**Release Date: TBD**

<span style="color:red">
This version introduces backwards-incompatible changes.</span>

## Breaking Changes
### BC removal
### Legacy code removal
### TLS on the REST layer is enabled by default
The new value of configuration parameter `searchguard.ssl.http.enabled` is `true` by default. If you want to disable TLS on the REST layer, set it to `false`. However, we strongly recommend keeping it enabled in production environments.
