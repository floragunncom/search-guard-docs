# Document Write History Audit Logging
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Search Guard can monitor both insertion and deletion of documents, as well as changes at the document field level.

## Audit Log Category

Events generated by the document write history audit trail are logged in the `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` category.

## Configuring the indices to watch

To enable the write history audit trail, list the indices to watch in elasticsearch.yml:

```yaml
searchguard.compliance.history.write.watched_indices:
  - indexname1
  - indexname2
```

For example:

```yaml
searchguard.compliance.history.write.watched_indices:
  - finance
```

In the example above, any write or delete operation by any user to the `finance` index will generate an audit event. Wildcards ares supported for index names.

## Field reference

Events in the `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` category have the following attributes:

### Format, timestamp and category attributes

| @timestamp | UTC timestamp when the event was generated|
| audit\_category | Audit log category, `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` for all events |

## Performance considerations

### Use diffs only on relevant indices

Logging the difference between two versions of a document has a performance impact. It should be used only on relevant data, and bulk updates should be minimized. 

### Keeping the watched indices at a minimum

The more indices you watch, the more events are possibly created. Consider only watching indices that you are required to monitor.
