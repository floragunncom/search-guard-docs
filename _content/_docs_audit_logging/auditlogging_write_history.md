# Write History Audit Logging
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Search Guard can monitor write access to sensitive data in Elasticsearch, and produce an audit trail of all write activity. It uses the [Audit Logging storage](auditlogging_storage.md) engine to ship the emitted audit events to one or more storage endpoints.

Search Guard tracks 

* insertion and deletion of documents 
* changes on field level

Changes on field level are written in [JSON patch format](http://jsonpatch.com/):

```json
[
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/date"
  },
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/revenue",
    "value": 67000
  },
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/customers"
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/remarks",
    "value": "none"
  }
]
```

The write history can be used to track changes to PII or otherwise sensitive data. The audit trail will contain date of access, the username, the document id, and a list of the changes on JSON patch format. 

By tracking the insertion and the deletion of documens you can prove when PII data was created and also deleted. This makes it extremely easy to implement GDPR, HIPAA, PCI or SOX compliance.

Audit logging and also the compliance features are statically configured in `elasticsearch.yml` and cannot be changed at runtime.

## Audit Log Category

Events generated by the read history audit trail are logged in the `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` category.

## Configuring the indices to watch

To enable the write history audit trail, list the indices to watch in elasticsearch.yml:

```yaml
searchguard.compliance.history.write.watched_indices:
  - indexname1
  - indexname2
```

For example:

```yaml
searchguard.compliance.history.write.watched_indices:
  - finance
```

In the example above, any write or delete operation by any user to the `finance` index will generate an audit event. Wildcards ares supported for index names.

## Excluding users

You can exclude users from the write history by listing them in `elasticsearch.yml`: 

```yaml
searchguard.compliance.history.read.ignore_users:
  - admin
```

## Configuring the event content

By default Search Guard logs

* the complete document content, in case it is newly created
* a diff in [JSON patch format](http://jsonpatch.com/), in case a document was changed

You can control the level of detail by the following configuration settings in elasticsearch.yml:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| searchguard.compliance.history.write.metadata_only | boolean, if set to true Search Guard will not log any document content, only meta data. Enable this if you need to know when a document was created, changed or delete, but you are not interested in the actual content. Default is false. |
| searchguard.compliance.history.write.log_diffs | boolean, if set to true Search Guard will log diffs for document updates. Default is false. |

## Field reference

Events in the `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` category have the following attributes:

### Format, timestamp and category attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_format\_version | Audit log message format version, current: 3|
| audit\_utc\_timestamp | UTC timestamp when the event was generated|
| audit\_category | Audit log category, `COMPLIANCE_DOC_WRITE` for all events|
{: .config-table}

### Cluster and node attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_cluster\_name | Name of the cluster this event was emitted on.|
| audit\_node\_id  | The ID of the node where the event was generated.|
| audit\_node\_name | The name of the node where the event was generated. |
| audit\_node\_host\_address |The host address of the node where the event was generated.|
| audit\_node\_host\_name |The host address of the node where the event was generated. |
| audit\_trace\_shard\_id | id of the shard |
{: .config-table}

### Request attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_request\_origin | The layer from which the event originated. One if `TRANSPORT` or `REST`.  |
| audit\_request\_remote\_address | The adress where the request came from.  |
{: .config-table}

### User attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_request\_effective\_user | The username of the user that has accessed watched fields |
{: .config-table}

### Index attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_trace\_indices | Array, the index name(s) as contained in the request. Can contain wildcards, date patterns and aliases.|
| audit\_trace\_resolved\_indices | Array, the resolved, concrete index name(s) affected by this request. Only logged if `resolve_indices` is true. Optional. |
{: .config-table}

### Document and fields attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_compliance\_operation | The operation on the document, can be one of `CREATE`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.  |
| audit\_trace\_doc\_id | Id of the document containing the watched fields. |
| audit\_trace\_doc\_version | The version of the document that has been inserted, changed or deleted. |
| audit\_request\_body | The diff of the old and new version of the document in JSON patch format. Only logged for `UPDATE`. |
| audit\_request\_body | The content of newly created documents. Only logged for   `CREATE`, and only if `searchguard.compliance.history.write.diffs_only` is `false`.|
{: .config-table}

}
```

## Performance considerations

### Use diffs only on relevant indices

Logging the difference between to versions of a document has a performance impact. It should be used only on relevant data, and bulk updates should be minimized. Performance will improve by leveraging new features in the upcoming Elasticsearch 6.3 release.

### Keeping the watched indices at a minumum

The more indices you watch, the more events are possibly created. Consider only watching indices that you are required to monitor.

### Use a high-volume storage type

The write history can emit a lot of events in a short time. Consider using a storage type or cache that can handle a high volume of events, like Kafka, Redis or AWS Kinesis.
