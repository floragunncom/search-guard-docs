# Elasticsearch configuration tracking
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Search Guard is able to monitor the integrity of your Elasticsearch installation and emit events describing your current configuration.

These features help to detect any changes to your Elasticsearch or Search Guard installation and for proofing that you applied critical fixes and upgrades in time.

The way Elasticsearch can be configured includes

* Setting in elasticsearch.yml
* Environment variables used in elasticsearch.yml
* Java properties
* Files used by Search Guard like PEM certificates, keystores or Kerberos keytabs

On node startup, Search Guard will emit an event that contains these settings and their respective sha256 checksum.

## Enabling and disabling configuration tracking

The elasticsearch configuration monitoring can be switched on an off by the following entry in elasticsearch.yml:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| searchguard.compliance.history.external\_config\_enabled | boolean, whether to enable or disable elasticsearch configuration logging. Default: true |
{: .config-table}

## Audit log category

The Elasticsearch configuration events are logged in the `COMPLIANCE_EXTERNAL_CONFIG`category. 

## Field reference

### Format, timestamp and category attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_format\_version | Audit log message format version, current: 3|
| audit\_utc\_timestamp | UTC timestamp when the event was generated|
| audit\_category | Audit log category, `COMPLIANCE_EXTERNAL_CONFIG` for all events|
{: .config-table}

### Cluster and node attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_cluster\_name | Name of the cluster this event was emitted on.|
| audit\_node\_id  | The ID of the node where the event was generated.|
| audit\_node\_name | The name of the node where the event was generated. |
| audit\_node\_elasticsearch\_version        | The Elasticsearch version of the node where the event was generated.|
| audit\_node\_host\_address |The host address of the node where the event was generated.|
| audit\_node\_host\_name |The host address of the node where the event was generated. |
{: .config-table}

### Configuration attributes

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| audit\_compliance\_file\_infos | All external files referenced in the configuration, with modification date and sha256 checksum.  |
| audit\_request\_body | Detailed configuration information as JSON string.  |
{: .config-table}

## File information

The `audit_compliance_file_infos` key contains an array that lists all files used by Search Guard that are configured in elasticsearch.yml. Example:

```json
"audit_compliance_file_infos" : [
   {
     "path" : "/etc/elasticsearch/truststore.jks",
     "sha256" : "502be6ca9080666271ee9122998e6793e19fda080be095da60bab5aae8243f17",
     "last_modified" : "2018-03-13T12:10:29.000+00:00",
     "key" : "searchguard.ssl.http.truststore_filepath"
   },
   {
     "path" : "/etc/elasticsearch/CN=sgssl-0.example.com,OU=SSL,O=Test,L=Test,C=DE-keystore.jks",
     "sha256" : "9a5058ca0efb0068aeafc307f86d4af48274dab315702e014e1cdaf4bcc32f3b",
     "last_modified" : "2018-03-13T12:10:29.000+00:00",
     "key" : "searchguard.ssl.transport.keystore_filepath"
   },
   {
     "path" : "/etc/elasticsearch/sgssl-0.example.com.http_srv.keytab",
     "sha256" : "bb12b7483d9c449ac27cf6e6c698172bf227dc1ea1892d9e27732071731b9f8c",
     "last_modified" : "2018-03-15T16:27:50.522+00:00",
     "key" : "searchguard.kerberos.acceptor_keytab_filepath"
   }
   ... 
]
```

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| path | Absolute path to the file |
| sha256 | SHA256 checksum of the file  |
| last_modified | Last modification date of the file  |
| key | The configuration key in elasticsearch.yml this file is referenced by.  |
{: .config-table}

## Configuration information

The detailed configuration settings can be found in the `audit_request_body` field of the generated event. The value is a JSON string with three keys:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| external_configuration | The content of the elasticsearch.yml on node startup |
| os_environment | Environment variables on node startup  |
| java_properties | Java properties on node startup  |
| sha256_checksum | SHA256 checksum of the combined external_configuration, os_environment and java_properties. Can be used to detect any changes to your Elasticsearch installation.  |
{: .config-table}

### External configuration

The `external_configuration` contains the `elasticsearch.yml` settings on node startup as JSON String. Example:

```json
{
	"external_configuration": {
		"elasticsearch_yml": {
			"searchguard": {
				"compliance": {
					"disable_anonymous_authentication": "true",
					"history": {
						"external_config_enabled": "true",
						"read": {
							"watched_fields": ["humanresources,Designation,FirstName,LastName"],
							"ignore_users": ["admin"]
						},
						"write": {
							"diffs_only": "true",
							"ignore_users": ["finance_trainee"],
							"watched_indices": ["finance"]
						},
						"metadata_only": "false"
					}
				},
				"kerberos": {
					"acceptor_principal": "HTTP/sgssl-0.example.com",
					"krb5_filepath": "/etc/krb5.conf",
					"acceptor_keytab_filepath": "sgssl-0.example.com.http_srv.keytab"
				},
				...
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Since the JSON object is stored as String, the quotation marks are escaped in the original output. Depending on your JSON parser you might need to remove them first.
{: .note .js-note .note-warning}

### Environment variables

The `os_environment` key contains all environment variables as String. Example:

```
"LANGUAGE=en_US:en, 
PATH=/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:
-Dsun.security.krb5.debug=false
-Dsun.security.spnego.debug=false
..."
```

### Java properties

The `java_environment` key contains all java properties as String. Example:

```
"java.version=1.8.0_151
java.vendor.url=http://java.oracle.com/
-Enetwork.host=sgssl-0.example.com
-Esearchguard.ssl.http.keystore_filepath=keystore.jks
-Esearchguard.kerberos.acceptor_keytab_filepath=sgssl-0.example.com.http_srv.keytab
..."
```
