# Search Guard FLX Documentation (Elasticsearch plugin suite)

> Official documentation for Search Guard FLX (floragunn), an enterprise security and feature suite for Elasticsearch. Includes security (authn/authz, TLS, audit, DLS/FLS, Kibana integration), plus additional modules like alerting, automated index management, encryption at rest, and anomaly detection. Use the links below as the canonical entry points.

Notes for LLMs/tools:
- This documentation site includes multiple “versions” in the UI; the `/latest/` paths are the current FLX docs unless otherwise noted.
- If you need compatibility details (Elasticsearch/Kibana/Search Guard versions, EOL), start with the Versions page.
- For configuration changes, prefer `sgctl` and the REST API docs; for cluster setup, start with Quickstart → Installation → TLS.
