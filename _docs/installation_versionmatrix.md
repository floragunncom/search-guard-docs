# Search Guard Versions

All Search Guard releases, past and present, are available on Maven Central. You can either download the releases from there (offline install) or use the Elasticsearch plugin install command to install Search Guard directly (online install). 

This page lists all available versions for Elasticsearch 6.x. For other releases please refer to:

* [Search Guard 7 for Elasticsearch 7.x](/latest/search-guard-versions)
* [Search Guard 5 for Elasticsearch 5.x](/v5/search-guard-versions)

**Please also refer to [Search Guard End of Life policy](eol-policy) to make sure that you are not running an outdated Search Guard or Elasticsearch version.**

## Search Guard 6

If you are upgrading from Elasticsearch 5.6.x to Elasticsearch >= 6.0.0, please read the [upgrade instructions to Elasticsearch to 6.x](upgrading-5-6).
